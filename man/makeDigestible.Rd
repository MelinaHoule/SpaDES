\usage{
makeDigestible(object, objects, compareRasterFileLength = 1e+06)

\S4method{makeDigestible}{simList}(object, objects,
  compareRasterFileLength = 1e+06)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object to convert to a 'digestible' state}

\item{objects}{Optional character vector indicating which objects are to
be considered while making digestible.}

\item{compareRasterFileLength}{Numeric. Optional. When there are Rasters, that
have file-backed storage, this is passed to the length arg in \code{digest}
when determining if the Raster file is already in the database.
Default 1e6. Passed to \code{prepareFileBackedRaster}.}
}
\value{
A simplified version of the \code{simList} object, but with no
        reference to any environments, or other session-specific information.
}
\description{
Using digest::digest will include every detail of an object, including
environments of functions, including those that are session-specific. Since
the goal of using digest::digest is not session specific, this function
attempts to strip all session specific information so that the digest
works between sessions and operating systems. It is tested under many
conditions and object types, there are bound to be others that don't
work correctly.
}
\details{
This is primarily for internal use only. Especially when
caching a \code{simList}.

This is a derivative of the class \code{simList}, except that all references
to local environments are removed.
Specifically, all functions (which are contained within environments) are
converted to a text representation via a call to \code{format(fn)}.
Also the objects that were contained within the \code{.envir} slot are hashed
using \code{digest::digest}.
The \code{paths} slot is not used (to allow comparison across platforms); it's
not relevant where the objects are gotten from, so long as they are the same.
The \code{.envir} slot is emptied (\code{NULL}).
The object is then converted to a \code{simList_} which has a \code{.list} slot.
The hashes of the objects are then placed in that \code{.list} slot.
